# Cooling and heating device based on a Peltier cell
# Authors 
- Gabriela Czerniak
# Description of the project 
A device utilising the capabilities of a Peltier cell connected via the L298N. Receives ambient or solid body temperature information via a waterproof probe. Information about the temperature as well as the heating or cooling status are shown on the LCD display. 
# Science and tech used 
Arduino Uno, DS18B20 1-Wire Temperature Sensor - Waterproof, L298N Motor Driver, LCD 16x2, rotary potentiometer 10kOhm, BreadBoard
# State of the art 
A device for laboratory use and beyond. Can be used as a mat when heat/cool distribution elements are added. 
# What next?
Increasing the possibilities by adding buttons to change the target temperature, possible modifications by adding relays.
