- Gabriela Czerniak
# Description of the project 
an Arduino-based module that records temperature via a waterproof probe, the information is presented on an LCD display. To control the temperature, a Peltier cell connected via a relay is switched on and off to control the temperature.
# Science and tech used 
Arduino Uno, DS18B20 1-Wire Temperature Sensor - Waterproof, Iduino relay module - 1 channel - 10A/250VAC contacts - 5V coil, LCD 16x2, rotary potentiometer 10kOhm, BreadBoard
# State of the art 
A device for laboratory use and beyond. Can be used as a mat when heat/cool distribution elements are added. 
# What next?
Increasing the possibilities by adding buttons to change the target temperature, possible modifications by adding relays.
